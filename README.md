[Moonlight for Android](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source client for NVIDIA GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield.

Moonlight for Android allows you to stream your full collection of games from your Windows PC to your Android device,
whether in your own home or over the internet. The Moonlight3D port offers the same functionality, with the added feature of stereoscopic 3D support for the Lume Pad 2 and Nubia Pad 3D tablets.

You can activate and deactivate 3D mode by holding 3 fingers on-screen for 1 second. Only Half-Width SBS 3D content is supported.

Moonlight also has a [PC client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) and [iOS/tvOS client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).

You can follow development on our [Discord server](https://moonlight-stream.org/discord) and help translate Moonlight into your language on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/moonlight/moonlight-android/).
